            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p class="tagline">Web development with a focus on responsive, 
            accessible design with a passion for combining SVG's with CSS animations.</p>
            <h2>Who I am</h2>
            <p>My name is Anthony Dixon a web developer from Blyth, Northumberland. 
            I have always been interested in IT and how it works. 
            From playing with Blender animations, Unreal Engine and Linux. I'm always looking to learn new skills. 
            I finally found that I enjoyed web design and have been studying web development.</p>
            <h3>The Design</h3>
            <p>I always start with Figma as it allows me to quickly get ideas down. 
            From there I can plan for  mobile responsiveness and accessibility. 
            For images I have a little experience with Gimp, Krita, Inkscape and I have some 
            experience building animations with Blender.</p>
            <h3>The Development</h3>
            <p>For development I prefer pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript with a little bit of SASS. 
            I have just started learning jQuery for including libraries, although I prefer to 
            tailor make each script with JavaScript for each project. For project management I use Git.</p>
