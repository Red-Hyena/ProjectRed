                <h1>Project #1 - Carehome Template</h1>
                <p>For the care home project I wanted to focus on accessibility. 
                The design utilizes a bright green against a deep purple, 
                which meets WCAG AA for readability. I also tried to incorporate 
                aria labels for the first time.</p>
                <p>The design is fairly simple with a focus on readability by using 
                slightly larger font sizes. The website also works on mobile devices as well.</p>

                <h2>Project #2 - Cupcake Shop Example</h1>
                <p>For the Cupcake shop I wanted to create a website that used a 
                script to keep a running cost. The website uses “owl-carousel” and is implemented 
                with jQuery. This allowed me to build a carousel that allows the user 
                to swipe on mobile devices to select a cupcake before being taken to the custom cupcake page.</p>
                <p>The script I wrote for the cost update essentially just listens 
                for which option is selected, returns that value and then the total
                cost takes the value of each option selected and adds them together.  
                For the text icing, it removes any white space and then multiplies the length of the
                 string by 0.10 and adds this to the total cost. (10p). </p>

                <h3>Project #3 - Sportsball FC</h1>
                <p>For Sportsball FC I wanted to create a fictional non-league football team 
                and give them some fixtures. Non-league teams often have fixture changes so the 
                difficulty was in creating a website that a non-technical user could interact 
                with to update fixtures and the website essentially builds itself.</p>
                <p>For the script I used objects with a constructor function to create the data. 
                The script once a user clicks “August” for example, then searches these objects 
                for any arrays that have “August” in the month category. It then creates elements 
                for each part of the array and uses an IF statement to determine if it is a home or away game. 
                So essentially each time a user click a month button, the script builds the page. 
                I'm hoping to expand this in the future so that it could take a Spreadsheet and convert
                it to an array via a string. This would make it easier on a 
                non-league club's staff member if they weren't familiar with computers.</p>
